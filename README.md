# Hi 👋

I'm a Fullstack Developer who believes in learning by building. My GitHub contains a collection of work-in-progress projects that showcase my skills. You'll find here various applications in different stages of development, from chat platforms to trading simulations and e-commerce solutions.

## About My Projects
My repositories serve as playgrounds for testing new ideas and implementing various features. Each project represents different aspects of web development, from real-time communication to data visualization and responsive design patterns.

To see all projects in action, visit my [Portfolio](https://fijolkrzysztof.github.io/portfolio/)

Archives: Some of my older, larger experiments and "failed" ideas live over at [IdeasThatLookedBetterOnPaper](https://github.com/IdeasThatLookedBetterOnPaper). It’s a graveyard of code that taught me what not to do.
